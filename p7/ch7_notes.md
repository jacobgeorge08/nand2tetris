## Ch. 7 summary 
here is a summary of the key concepts, terms, and processes we covered while
exploring chapter 7 of "the elements of computing systems," which focuses on
implementing a virtual machine (vm) using stack arithmetic:

**i. the virtual machine (vm):**

* **concept:** a virtual machine is a software-based emulation of a physical
computer system. our vm, built in python, simulates a simplified computer
architecture to execute a specific set of instructions.
* **purpose:** 
    * **hardware abstraction:** the vm provides a layer of abstraction over the
    underlying physical hardware (cpu, memory) so that programs written in the
    vm language don't need to be aware of the specifics of the computer they're
    running on.
    * **software abstraction:** the vm's simplified instruction set makes it
    easier to write programs and compilers compared to working directly with
    low-level machine code.

**ii. the stack and stack pointer:**

* **stack data structure:** the stack is a fundamental data structure that
operates on the last-in, first-out (lifo) principle. think of it like a stack
of plates: you can only add (push) or remove (pop) plates from the top. 
* **stack pointer (`stack_pointer`):**  this is a special variable that always
points to the top element of the stack. it indicates the next available
location where data can be pushed.
* **importance:** the stack is heavily used by the vm for:
    * performing arithmetic and logical operations. 
    * managing function calls (arguments, return addresses, local variables).

**iii.  memory segments:**

* **purpose:** memory segments organize the vm's memory space into distinct
regions, each serving a specific purpose. 
* **key segments:**
    * **`stack` segment:**  the main stack used for computations and function
    calls.
    * **`local` segment:** stores local variables for the currently executing
    function. 
    * **`argument` segment:** holds arguments passed to a function.
    * **`static` segment:** stores static variables associated with the vm
    program.
    * **`constant` segment:** not a real memory segment but a way to represent
    constant values directly within instructions.
    * **`this` and `that` segments:** used for object-oriented operations
    (covered in more detail in chapter 8). 
    * **`temp` and `pointer` segments:** also part of the vm's memory map, but
    their use is less common. 

**iv. base pointers:**

* **role:** base pointers are special variables that store the starting
addresses of different memory segments. 
* **key base pointers:**
    * `stack_pointer`: points to the top of the stack. 
    * `local_base`:  points to the beginning of the local segment for the
    currently executing function.
    * `argument_base`: points to the beginning of the argument segment for the
    currently executing function.
    * other segments have base pointers as well.

**v. stack frames and function calls:**

* **stack frame concept:**  a stack frame is a temporary structure created on
the stack *each time a function is called*. it acts as a dedicated workspace
for the function. 
* **stack frame contents:**
    * **arguments:** values passed to the function, pushed onto the stack
    *before* the function call.
    * **return address:**  the memory address of the instruction in the
    *calling code* where execution should resume after the function completes.
    * **local variables:**  space for the function's local variables, allocated
    within the stack frame.
* **function call mechanism (simplified):**
    1. **calling code:**  pushes arguments onto the stack.
    2. **`call` instruction:**
       - pushes the return address onto the stack. 
       - jumps to the first instruction of the called function.
    3. **function prologue:**
       - saves the previous `local_base` pointer by pushing it onto the stack.
       - sets the new `local_base` pointer to allocate space for local
       variables.
       - adjusts other pointers (like `argument_base`) if needed. 
    4. **function executes:**  performs its operations, using local variables
    within its frame.
    5. **return value (optional):** places the return value at a specific stack
    location (usually the beginning of its frame). 
    6. **function epilogue:**
       - restores the previous `local_base` pointer.
       - adjusts the `stack_pointer` to remove the local variables and
       arguments.
    7. **`return` instruction:** 
       - pops the return address from the stack.
       - jumps to the return address, resuming execution in the calling code.

**vi. vm instructions:**

- the vm has a set of instructions covering these categories:
    * **arithmetic/logical:** `add`, `sub`, `neg`, `eq`, `gt`, `lt`, `and`,
    `or`, `not`
    * **memory access:** `push segment index`, `pop segment index` 
    * **program flow control:** `label`, `goto`, `if-goto`
    * **function calls:** `function`, `call`, `return` 

**vii. implementing the vm:**

- the process involved:
    1. **instruction parsing:**  reading and interpreting vm code instructions.
    2. **memory management:** implementing the stack, segments, base pointers,
    and logic to access memory correctly.
    3. **instruction execution:** writing code to perform the operations
    specified by each instruction. 
    4. **function call implementation:**  handling the creation, use, and
    cleanup of stack frames to manage function calls.
